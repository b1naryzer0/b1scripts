how to make your powershell more unix-like by changing autocomplete to global
- open an admin powershell
- notepad.exe $PROFILE
- if there is no profile file yet, it will be created
- add the following to your profile file: 
- Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete
- save, close the shell, open up a new powershell
- now type a part of a file name and press TAB
- ps now shows fitting executables system-wide (must be in %PATH%, ofc)
- hint: if there are many files, you’ll be asked if you want to see all of them, answer with ‘Y’ or ‘N’, regardless of your keyboard
